artistapi a.k.a. A.R.S.
=======================

A.R.S. is Artist REST Service.

Tiny NodeJS based web app returning a random artist name in JSON format

I needed an API to get random artist names. I already had a list of 710 artists. I made this in NodeJS and Mongo. This is really simple and no rocket science, but I want it to do just that: give a response in JSON format containing a randomly chosen artist name.

Credits: ax710 for the list of artist names.
